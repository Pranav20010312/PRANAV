   <h1>WHAT IS AN PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE</h1>
  </footer>
  <section>
   <p>A <strong>programming</strong> language is a formal language comprising a set of strings that produce various kinds of machine code output. Programming languages are one kind of computer language, and are used in computer programming to implement algorithms.</p>
  </section>

   <p>
    Most programming languages consist of instructions for <mark>computers</mark>. There are programmable machines that use a set of specific instructions, rather than general programming languages. Since the early 1800s, programs have been used to direct the behavior of machines such as Jacquard looms, music boxes and player pianos.The programs for these machines (such as a player piano's scrolls) did not produce different behavior in response to different inputs or conditions.

   <p>Thousands of different programming languages have been created, and more are being created every year. Many programming languages are written in an imperative form (i.e., as a sequence of operations to perform) while other languages use the declarative form (i.e. the desired result is specified, not how to achieve it)</p>
   <p>The description of a programming language is usually split into the two components of syntax (form) and semantics (meaning). Some languages are defined by a specification document (for example, the C programming language is specified by an ISO Standard) while other languages (such as Perl) have a dominant implementation that is treated as a reference. Some languages have both, with the basic language defined by a standard and extensions taken from the dominant implementation being common.</p>
   <p>Programming language theory is a subfield of computer science that deals with the design, implementation, analysis, characterization, and classification of programming languages.</p>

   <h1><strong>Types of Programming Languages</strong></h1>
   <p>The different types of programming languages are discussed below.</p>
   <img src="programmingparadigms.jpg" alt="paradigms" width="300"/>
   <h2><strong>Procedural Programming Language</strong></h2>
   <p>The procedural programming language is used to execute a sequence of statements which lead to a result. Typically, this type of programming language uses multiple variables, heavy loops and other elements, which separates them from functional programming languages. Functions of procedural language may control variables, other than function’s value  returns. For example, printing out information.</p>  
  </section>
  <section>
   <h2><strong>Functional Programming Language</strong></h2>
   <p>Functional programming language typically uses stored data, frequently avoiding loops in favor of recursive functions.The functional programing’s  primary focus is on the return values of functions, and side effects and different suggests that storing state are powerfully discouraged. For example, in an exceedingly pure useful language, if a function is termed, it’s expected that the function not modify or perform any o/p. It may, however, build algorithmic calls and alter the parameters of these calls. Functional languages are usually easier and build it easier to figure on abstract issues, however, they’ll even be “further from the machine” therein their programming model makes it difficult to know precisely, but the code is decoded into machine language (which are often problematic for system programming).</p>  
  </section>
  <section>
   <h2><strong>Object-oriented Programming Language</strong></h2>
   <p>This programming language  views the world as a group of objects that have internal data and external accessing parts of that data. The aim this programming language  is to think about the fault by separating it into a collection of objects that offer services which can be used to solve a specific problem. One of the main principle of object oriented programming language  is encapsulation that everything an object will need must be inside of the object. This language also emphasizes reusability through inheritance and the capacity to spread current implementations without having to change a great deal of code by using polymorphism.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
   <h2><strong>Scripting Programming Language</strong></h2>   
   <p>These programming languages are often procedural and may comprise object-oriented language elements, but they fall into their own category as they are normally not full-fledged programming languages with support for development of large systems. For example, they may not have compile-time type checking. Usually, these languages require tiny syntax to get started.</p>   
  </section>
  <section>
   <h2><strong>Logic Programming Language</strong></h2>   
   <p>These types of languages let programmers  make declarative statements and then allow the machine to reason about the consequences of those statements. In a sense, this language doesn’t tell the computer how to do something, but employing restrictions on what it must consider doing.To call these groups ” types  of language ” is really a bit confusing. It’s easy to program in an object-oriented style in C language. In truth, most of the languages include ideas and features from various domains, which only helps to increase the  usefulness of these types of languages. Nevertheless, most of the programming languages do not best in all styles of programming.</p>

  <section>
   <h3>C LANGUAGE</h3>
   <p>The C language is a  basic programming language and it is a very popular language, particularly used in game programming, Because C language includes the additional packing of the C++, Every programmer uses this language because it makes programs faster . However the value of this language gives the reusability of C++ to get the slight increase in performance with C language.</p>

  <section>
   <h3>C++ LANGUAGE</h3>
   <p>The C++ language has an object oriented structure which is used in large projects. Programmers can collaborate one program into different parts or even one individual work on each part of the program. The structure of object oriented also permit code to be reused many times.This language is an efficient language. But, many programmers will disagree</p>

   <h3>JAVA LANGUAGE</h3>
   <p>The Java language is a multi platform language that’s particularly helpful in networking. Of course, mostly this language is used on the web with Java applets. However, this language is used to design cross platform programs, Since it similar to C++ in structure and syntax. For C++ programmers, Java language is very easy to learn and it offers some advantages provided by object oriented  programming. Like reusability and it can be difficult to write efficient code in Java. But, nowadays the speed of the Java language has increased and 1.5 version offers some good features for easy program making.</p>

   <h3>PASCAL LANGUAGE</h3>
   <p>Pascal language is mostly a teaching language and few industries uses this language to write the programs. This language tends to use keywords instead of symbols and braces in C language. So this language is very easy for beginners to understand than a programming language like C, C++. Borland is a compiler software company, which is using Delphi programming language for industrial strength. Delphi is an object oriented language of Pascal, and presently  Borland compilers only use it.</p>

   <h3>PHP LANGUAGE</h3>
   <p>The PHP language is used to design web pages and sometimes it is also used as scripting language. This language is designed to develop a rapid website, and as a result comprises features which make it easy generate HTTP headers and link to databases. As a scripting language, it includes a set of components permit the programmer to easily get up to speed. However, it has more  sophisticated object oriented feature</p>

   <h3>PYTHON LANGUAGE</h3>
   <p>Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language. Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant indentation.</p>
